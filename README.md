# python_name_asking_code
One of my earliest assignments when I first started college as an Information Systems student.
This code was one of the first homeworks my lecturer gave me, the subject was "Basics of Programming"
The code is written in Indonesian because I wanted to keep the originality of the source.

## The code just asks for your name and your nickname

<br />

## The code will give you a warning when you don't input anything (the name and the nickname)

<br />

## The code will also be aware that you've only given the name or the nickname.

<br />

## Now this is the correct output, with both the name and the nickname being present.
